NOTES
=====

These examples assume you've installed the QUALCOMM SDK and
Visual Studio .NET, as well as doc++. (If you don't have doc++,
building these Microsoft Visual Studio solutions will complain,
but you can ignore the error in the post-build step.)

You can find a prototypical makefile for the
ARM BREW Builder in Main/main.mak.

For best results, you should consider installing doc++ from 
docpp.sourceforge.net. With doc++, building any of these examples
will also create an HTML directory containing documentation for 
each of the relevant structures and functions in the application.

I hope you enjoy learning QUALCOMM BREW with the aid of these examples
as much as I enjoyed writing them for you!

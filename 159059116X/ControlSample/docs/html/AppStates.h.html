This file provides the structures and interface for a state
machine manager based on a single stack to track application
state transitions.

<P>To the user, a state is a screen.
Programmatically, a state is an ordered tuple containing

<P>-- a memory region to hold internal scratch data

<P>-- event handler

<P>The currently active state --- that at the top of the stack -- 
will have its functions called. Other states on the stack do 
not receive function calls.</BLOCKQUOTE>
